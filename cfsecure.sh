Usage: cfsecure [OPTIONS] [files...]

Truly secure file sharing with end-to-end encryption.

Options:
  -p, --password PWD    Set password for encryption (required)
  -d, --duration TIME   How long to keep files (default: 1h)
  -h, --help           Show this help

How it works:
  1. Files are encrypted locally with your password
  2. Encrypted files are uploaded to a temporary location
  3. Recipients need the password to decrypt and view files
  4. Files auto-delete after the specified duration

Examples:
  cfsecure -p secret123 document.pdf
  cfsecure -p mypass -d 24h photo.jpg video.mp4

Note: This provides TRUE password protection. Files cannot be
accessed without the password, even with direct URLs.

ENCRYPTED FILE SHARE
====================

These files are encrypted and require a password to open.

To decrypt a file:
1. Download the .enc file
2. Run: openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -pbkdf2 -in FILENAME.enc -out FILENAME -pass pass:PASSWORD
3. Replace PASSWORD with the actual password

Or use the provided decrypt.sh script:
./decrypt.sh PASSWORD FILENAME.enc

Files will auto-delete after: $DURATION
