## Python Import Issues

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work

**Problem**: `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'Config' referenced before assignment`

**Root Cause**: Having multiple `from app.utils.config import Config` statements within the same file - one at the top level and others inside functions. Python treats variables as local if they're assigned anywhere in the function scope, even if the assignment comes after the reference.

```python
# At top of file
from app.utils.config import Config

async def main_function():
    if not Config.MATRIX_ACTIVE:  # ‚ùå UnboundLocalError here
        return
    
    # ... later in the function or in helper functions
    def helper_function():
        from app.utils.config import Config  # ‚ùå This causes the error
        return Config.SOME_VALUE
```

### ‚úÖ What Worked

**Solution**: Remove all redundant import statements within functions and rely on the top-level import.

```python
# At top of file
from app.utils.config import Config

async def main_function():
    if not Config.MATRIX_ACTIVE:  # ‚úÖ Works correctly
        return
    
    def helper_function():
        # ‚úÖ Use the top-level import, no local import needed
        return Config.SOME_VALUE
```

### üîß Standard Operating Procedure

1. **Always import modules at the top level** of the file
2. **Avoid redundant imports** within functions unless absolutely necessary
3. **Use grep to check for duplicate imports**: `grep -n "from.*import Config" filename.py`
4. **Test imports in isolation** when debugging import issues

## Streamlit Development Best Practices

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work

**Problem**: Modifying widget state after instantiation
```python
# ‚ùå This causes errors
st.session_state.confirm_user_removal = False  # After widget creation
```

**Problem**: Not handling session state persistence properly across reruns

### ‚úÖ What Worked

**Solution**: Proper session state management
```python
# ‚úÖ Initialize before widget creation
if 'confirm_user_removal' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.confirm_user_removal = False

# ‚úÖ Use callbacks for state updates
def on_user_selection_change():
    st.session_state.selected_users = st.session_state.user_multiselect

st.multiselect("Users", options=users, on_change=on_user_selection_change, key="user_multiselect")
```

### üîß Standard Operating Procedure

1. **Initialize session state variables early** in the function
2. **Use unique keys** for all widgets to avoid conflicts
3. **Use callbacks** for complex state management instead of direct modification
4. **Test widget interactions** thoroughly, especially with multiple selections
5. **Cache expensive operations** using `@st.cache_data` or session state

---

## Matrix Integration Challenges

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work

**Problem**: Bot permission issues preventing user removal
- Bot had only Moderator privileges instead of Admin
- Removal operations failed with `M_FORBIDDEN` errors

**Problem**: Relying on stale local cache for room memberships

### ‚úÖ What Worked

**Solution**: Multi-layered approach to user removal
1. **Live verification** of user memberships from Matrix API
2. **Smart filtering** to only attempt removal from rooms where users are actually members
3. **Enhanced error handling** with specific error messages
4. **Automatic cache refresh** after successful operations

```python
# ‚úÖ Live verification approach
try:
    client = await get_matrix_client()
    all_bot_rooms = await get_joined_rooms_async(client)
    
    for room_id in all_bot_rooms:
        room_members = await get_room_members_async(client, room_id)
        if user_id in room_members:
            user_actual_room_ids.append(room_id)
except Exception as e:
    # Fallback to database cache
    logger.warning(f"Using database fallback: {e}")
```

### üîß Standard Operating Procedure

1. **Always verify bot permissions** before attempting administrative actions
2. **Use live API calls** for critical operations, with database cache as fallback
3. **Implement comprehensive error handling** with specific error types
4. **Log all Matrix operations** for audit trails
5. **Test with actual Matrix rooms** in development environment

---

## Database and Session Management

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work

**Problem**: Database session conflicts and unclosed connections
```python
# ‚ùå Session management issues
db = next(get_db())
# ... operations without proper cleanup
```

**Problem**: SQLite-specific function issues
```
sqlite3.OperationalError: no such function: string_agg
```

### ‚úÖ What Worked

**Solution**: Proper session management with try/finally blocks
```python
# ‚úÖ Proper session handling
db = next(get_db())
try:
    # Database operations
    result = db.query(Model).all()
    db.commit()
finally:
    db.close()
```

**Solution**: Database-agnostic queries or conditional SQL

### üîß Standard Operating Procedure

1. **Always use try/finally** for database session cleanup
2. **Test with both SQLite and PostgreSQL** if supporting multiple databases
3. **Use database-agnostic ORM methods** when possible
4. **Monitor for unclosed sessions** in logs
5. **Implement connection pooling** for production environments

---

## Error Handling and Debugging Strategies

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work

**Problem**: Silent failures without proper error reporting
**Problem**: Generic error messages that don't help with debugging
**Problem**: Not testing edge cases (empty user lists, network failures, etc.)

### ‚úÖ What Worked

**Solution**: Comprehensive error handling strategy
```python
# ‚úÖ Detailed error handling
try:
    result = await some_operation()
    if result:
        logger.info(f"Operation successful: {result}")
        return result
    else:
        logger.warning("Operation returned no result")
        return None
except SpecificException as e:
    logger.error(f"Specific error in operation: {e}")
    # Handle specific case
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error in operation: {e}", exc_info=True)
    # Handle general case
```

### üîß Standard Operating Procedure

1. **Create isolated test scripts** for debugging complex issues
2. **Use specific exception handling** rather than generic `except Exception`
3. **Log with appropriate levels** (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
4. **Include context** in error messages (user IDs, room IDs, etc.)
5. **Test error conditions** explicitly (network failures, permission issues)
6. **Use `exc_info=True`** for detailed stack traces in logs

## Code Organization and Structure

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work

**Problem**: Massive functions with multiple responsibilities
**Problem**: Inconsistent indentation causing syntax errors
**Problem**: Mixing UI logic with business logic

### ‚úÖ What Worked

**Solution**: Modular function design
```python
# ‚úÖ Separate concerns
async def render_matrix_messaging_page():
    """Main UI rendering function"""
    if not _validate_matrix_config():
        return
    
    matrix_rooms = _get_cached_rooms()
    _render_room_selection_ui(matrix_rooms)
    _render_messaging_ui()

def _validate_matrix_config():
    """Helper function for validation"""
    return Config.MATRIX_ACTIVE

def _get_cached_rooms():
    """Helper function for data fetching"""
    # Implementation
```

### üîß Standard Operating Procedure

1. **Break large functions** into smaller, focused functions
2. **Use consistent indentation** (4 spaces for Python)
3. **Separate UI rendering** from business logic
4. **Use descriptive function names** that indicate purpose
5. **Add docstrings** for complex functions
6. **Use helper functions** with leading underscore for internal use

## SSL/TLS and Network Issues

### ‚ùå What Didn't Work

**Problem**: SSL version compatibility issues
```
[SSL: TLSV1_ALERT_PROTOCOL_VERSION] tlsv1 alert protocol version
```

**Problem**: Network timeouts without proper retry logic

### ‚úÖ What Worked

**Solution**: Flexible SSL configuration
```python
# ‚úÖ Configurable SSL settings
ssl_context = ssl.create_default_context()
if Config.MATRIX_DISABLE_SSL_VERIFICATION:
    ssl_context.check_hostname = False
    ssl_context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
```

**Solution**: Retry logic with exponential backoff

### üîß Standard Operating Procedure

1. **Make SSL settings configurable** for different environments
2. **Implement retry logic** for network operations
3. **Use connection pooling** to reduce connection overhead
4. **Log network errors** with sufficient detail for debugging
5. **Test with different network conditions** (slow, unreliable connections)

## Git Workflow and Pull Request Best Practices

### The Habits That Make PRs Easy to Review

#### Branching
- **Create a fresh branch per task**: Use descriptive names like `feat/login-button`, `bugfix/timeout-500`, `chore/dep-bumps`
- **Keep PRs small & focused**: Ideal size is < ~300 lines of effective diff. Split big changes into multiple PRs
- **Branch from main**: Always create feature branches from the latest main branch
- **Delete merged branches**: Clean up after successful merges to keep the repository tidy

#### Commits

**‚úÖ What Works**
```bash
# Meaningful commit messages with type and scope
feat(auth): add OAuth flow with PKCE
fix(api): handle 429 with jittered backoff
chore(deps): upgrade react to v18
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

**‚ùå What Doesn't Work**
```bash
# Vague or unhelpful messages
fixed bug
update
wip
more changes
```

**Best Practices:**
- **Write meaningful messages**: Start with a type (feat, fix, chore, docs) and include scope
- **Commit logically**: Each commit should compile and pass tests
- **Prefer squash merge**: Keep main branch history clean with focused commits
- **Atomic commits**: One logical change per commit

#### Pull Request Descriptions

**‚úÖ Effective PR Structure:**

```markdown
## Summary
Brief 1-3 line summary of what this PR accomplishes and why it's needed.

## Changes
- Added user authentication with OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow
- Implemented session management with secure cookies  
- Updated API endpoints to require authentication

## Breaking Changes
- `/api/users` now requires authentication token
- Session cookie structure changed (users need to re-login)

## How to Test
1. Run `npm install && npm start`
2. Navigate to `/login` and test OAuth flow
3. Verify protected routes redirect to login
4. Test logout functionality

## Screenshots
[Include screenshots for UI changes]

## Links
- Fixes #123
- Related to #456
- Spec: [link to design document]
```

**‚ùå Poor PR Descriptions:**
- Empty descriptions
- Just "Fixed the thing"
- No context about what changed or why
- Missing test instructions

### üîß Standard Operating Procedure for Git Workflow

#### Before Starting Work
1. **Switch to main and pull latest changes**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create descriptive branch name**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/user-profile-settings
   ```

3. **Understand the scope** - keep the branch focused on one feature/fix

#### During Development
1. **Make frequent, logical commits**
   ```bash
   git add -p  # Review changes before committing
   git commit -m "feat(profile): add user avatar upload"
   ```

2. **Keep commits focused** - one logical change per commit
3. **Test each commit** - ensure the code compiles and basic tests pass
4. **Rebase regularly** to keep history clean if working on long-running branches

#### Creating Pull Requests
1. **Push branch and create PR early** for feedback
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feat/user-profile-settings
   gh pr create --title "Add user profile settings page"
   ```

2. **Write comprehensive description** using the template above
3. **Include screenshots/gifs** for UI changes
4. **Link to issues** and related PRs
5. **Mark as draft** if not ready for review

#### Review Process
1. **Self-review first** - check your own PR before requesting review
2. **Respond to feedback promptly** and address all comments
3. **Update tests** if functionality changed
4. **Resolve conflicts** by rebasing or merging main
5. **Squash commits** before merging to keep history clean

#### After Merge
1. **Delete the feature branch**
   ```bash
   git branch -d feat/user-profile-settings
   git push origin --delete feat/user-profile-settings
   ```

2. **Update local main**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

### Common Git Workflows

#### Feature Development
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/new-feature

# Work and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement core functionality"
git commit -m "test: add unit tests for new feature"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feat/new-feature
gh pr create --title "Add new feature" --body "Description..."

# After approval, squash merge
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch
```

#### Hotfix Process
```bash
# Create hotfix from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug

# Make minimal fix
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve critical security issue"

# Fast-track review and merge
git push -u origin hotfix/critical-bug
gh pr create --title "HOTFIX: Critical security fix"
```

### Git Configuration Best Practices

```bash
# Set up meaningful commit template
git config --global commit.template ~/.gitmessage

# Configure merge behavior
git config --global pull.rebase true
git config --global rebase.autoStash true

# Better diff and merge tools
git config --global diff.tool vimdiff
git config --global merge.tool vimdiff
```

## Standard Operating Procedures

### Development Workflow

1. **Before making changes:**
   - Test current functionality to establish baseline
   - Create isolated test scripts for complex features
   - Check for existing similar implementations

2. **During development:**
   - Make small, incremental changes
   - Test each change immediately
   - Use proper error handling from the start
   - Log important operations for debugging

3. **After making changes:**
   - Test the specific functionality changed
   - Test related functionality that might be affected
   - Check logs for any new errors or warnings
   - Verify imports and syntax with `python -m py_compile`

### Debugging Workflow

1. **Identify the problem:**
   - Check logs for specific error messages
   - Isolate the failing component
   - Create minimal reproduction case

2. **Investigate systematically:**
   - Check imports and dependencies
   - Verify configuration values
   - Test with simplified inputs
   - Use debugging scripts to isolate issues

3. **Fix and verify:**
   - Make targeted fixes
   - Test the fix in isolation
   - Test integration with the full system
   - Update documentation if needed

### Code Quality Checklist

- [ ] All imports are at the top level (no redundant imports in functions)
