# Shell Configuration Files

This directory contains a modular shell configuration for ZSH that separates functionality into dedicated files for better organization and maintainability.

## Files Structure

- `.zshrc` - Main shell configuration file that loads all modular files
- `.zsh_aliases` - Basic shell aliases for common commands
- `.zsh_functions` - General utility functions for file operations
- `.zsh_git` - Git-related functions and aliases
- `.zsh_apps` - Application launcher functions
- `.zsh_network` - Network-related utilities
- `.zsh_transfer` - File transfer utilities
- `.zsh_security` - Security-related functions (encryption, virus scanning)
- `.zsh_utils` - Miscellaneous utility functions
- `.zsh_docker` - Docker-related aliases and functions

## Installation

1. Copy these files to your home directory
2. Run the `check_zsh_config.sh` script to verify that all files are properly set up
3. Source your `.zshrc` file: `source ~/.zshrc`

## Maintenance

- To add new functionality, add it to the appropriate modular file
- Run the `check_zsh_config.sh` script periodically to ensure your configuration is up to date

## Helper Scripts

- `check_zsh_config.sh` - Verifies that all modular files are properly set up
- `initial_macos_setup.sh` - Initial setup script for macOS
